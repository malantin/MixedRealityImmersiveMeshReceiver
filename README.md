# MixedRealityImmersiveMeshReceiver
Sample project showing how to receive room mesh data from a HoloLens device via the network in Immersive Windows Mixed Reality applications. It demonstrates how to receive the data with UWP APIs instead on the .Net Framework APIs used in the MR toolkit. This sample is still a work in progress and simply for demonstration purposes right now.

This code will be integrated with the MR toolkit for mesh transfer later on to be able to receive mesh data from a Hololens in an immserive Windows Mixed Reality application.
